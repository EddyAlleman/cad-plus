![Commands in the custom SOLIDWORKS toolbar](custom-sw-toolbar.png)

**Custom Toolbar** is a SOLIDWORKS add-in allowing to [create custom toolbars and menus](configuration) for the macros with an option to define title, description and icon.

Macros in the custom toolbars can be [customized](customization) in the same way as any other standard command in SOLIDWORKS, e.g. it is possible to assign the shortcut or place the command into the command manager tab box or other toolbar. In addition macro can be executed based on the various [triggers](configuration/triggers).

In addition **Custom Toolbar** allows [sharing](multi-user) the settings between multiple users enabling unified multi-user environment for using the macros within the organization.
